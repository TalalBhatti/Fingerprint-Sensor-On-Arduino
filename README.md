# Fingerprint-Sensor-On-Arduino
As you can see there are two steps for the Fingerprint sensor, First you have to add upto 10 fingerprints for the accuracy by using the code in folder Saving Fingerprints. Secondly, you have to run the main code for the detection as you can see on the bottom of that code. A pin is set to be high on Low which can be used for many reasons, I have used that pin for the ignition trigger through the Relay.
Delete code or simply reset the arduino for the deletion of codes.
